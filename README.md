NPM commands need to be run from the top level of the repository. This may change in future if different implementations need their own scripts or dependencies.

Install dependencies with `npm install`

Uses JavaScript Standard Style - run `npm run lint` to view issues, and `npm run lint:fix` to automagically fix them.

A useful pre-commit hook (save as `.git/hooks/pre-commit`) to ensure the the code is formatted correctly and you haven't accidentally left your personal details in is (change 000123456 to your account code or other personal data you want to search for):

```sh
#!/bin/sh
npm run lint && ! grep --exclude=pre-commit -r '000123456' .
```

Warning: It is still possible to commit your data if you stage it, delete it and then commit. Please be careful!
